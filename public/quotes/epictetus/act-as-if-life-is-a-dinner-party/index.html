<p>&ldquo;Remember that you must behave in life as at a dinner party. Is anything brought around to you? Put out your hand and take your share with moderation. Does it pass by you? Don’t stop it. Is it not yet come? Don’t stretch your desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you. Do this with regard to children, to a wife, to public posts, to riches, and you will eventually be a worthy partner of the feasts of the gods. And if you don’t even take the things which are set before you, but are able even to reject them, then you will not only be a partner at the feasts of the gods, but also of their empire.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe in living a life of moderation and self-control. This passage speaks to that principle. The metaphor of a dinner party is meant to remind us to be mindful of our actions and reactions to the events of our lives.</p>
<p>In essence, we should approach every situation in life with equanimity and a lack of attachment. When something is brought to us, whether it be material possessions or opportunities, we should take what is rightfully ours with moderation. However, if something passes us by or is not yet available, we should not cling to it or become overly attached.</p>
<p>This idea can be applied to many aspects of life, such as our relationships with our children, spouse, and friends, as well as our interactions with the public, wealth, and status. By embracing this philosophy, we can live a life of inner peace and contentment, becoming worthy partners of the feasts of the gods and even sharing in their power and authority.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is rooted in the idea of self-mastery and self-control. It emphasises the importance of developing a strong and unshakable inner core, so that one can remain steadfast in the face of life&rsquo;s challenges. By following our lessons, one can find peace and fulfillment, even amidst the turmoil and chaos of the world around us.</p>
<p>I encourage you to adopt this mindset and live each day with moderation and self-control. Remember that you must behave in life as at a dinner party. Take what is rightfully yours with grace and let the rest pass by without attachment. By doing so, you will be well on your way to becoming a worthy partner of the gods, living a life filled with peace, purpose, and happiness.</p>
