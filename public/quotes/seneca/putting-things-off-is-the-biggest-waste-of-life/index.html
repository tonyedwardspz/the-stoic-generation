      <blockquote>
<p>“Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortune’s control, and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To what goal are you straining? The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, Seneca, emphasize the importance of living in the present and avoiding the tendency to constantly postpone things until later. This kind of behavior, I argue, is a waste of life as it deprives us of the opportunities available in the moment and steals each day as it arrives. I believe that expectancy, or the tendency to constantly think about the future and what it might hold, is the greatest obstacle to living a happy life.</p>
<p>To truly experience the present, I advise that we must not allow our dreams and expectations for the future to govern our actions. Instead, we should focus on what is within our control and seize the opportunities presented to us each day. This serves as a reminder that the future is uncertain and it is pointless to spend time and energy worrying about things that may never come to pass.</p>
<p>I encourage individuals to embrace the chances and experiences each day has to offer, live in the moment, and concentrate on what is within their control. This serves as a reminder that nothing in life is certain, so there is no reason to waste time putting things off or worrying about the future.</p>
