      <description>&amp;ldquo;You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: Everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly, everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, ‘What are you thinking about?’ you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that.”
My dear reader, allow me to expound upon the meaning behind this quote. It is a fundamental tenet of Stoicism that one must control and regulate their thoughts, for the mind is the birthplace of all action and emotion.</description>
