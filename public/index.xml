      <description>&amp;ldquo;How much trouble he avoids by not looking to see what his neighbour does or thinks - by looking only to what he does himself, that it may be just and pure. The part of the good man is not to peer into the character of others, but to run straight down the line without glancing to one side or the other.&amp;rdquo;
Let us take a moment to contemplate the wisdom of these words.</description>

      <title>Are you frightened by change?</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Frightened of change? But what can exist without it? What’s closer to nature’s heart? Can you take a hot bath and leave the firewood as it was? Eat food without transforming it? Can any vital process take place without something being changed?
Can’t you see? It’s just the same with you — and just as vital to nature.&amp;rdquo;
Change is an inevitable part of life. It is essential that you accept it.</description>

      <title>Never beginning to live</title>

      <description>It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.
Ah, my dear reader, this quote speaks to the heart of our philosophy and the true meaning of life. To live is to experience the world around us. To engage with it. To learn from it. To grow from it. To not live, to never begin, is to miss out on this great opportunity and to waste the gift of existence that has been granted to us.</description>

      <title>Act as if life is a dinner party</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Remember that you must behave in life as at a dinner party. Is anything brought around to you? Put out your hand and take your share with moderation. Does it pass by you? Don’t stop it. Is it not yet come? Don’t stretch your desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you. Do this with regard to children, to a wife, to public posts, to riches, and you will eventually be a worthy partner of the feasts of the gods.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: &amp;ldquo;I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”
So you were born to feel “nice”?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Remember how long you have been putting this off, how many times you have been given a period of grace by the gods and not used it. It is high time now for you to understand the universe of which you are a part, and the governor of that universe of whom you constitute an emanation: and that there is a limit circumscribed to your time - if you do not use it to clear away your clouds, it will be and the opportunity will not return.</description>

      <guid>/quotes/marcus-aurelius/everything-that-happens-is-endurable/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;Everything that happens is either endurable or not. If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining. If it’s unendurable—then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as well. Just remember: you can endure anything your mind can make endurable, by treating it as in your interest to do so.”
The sage words of Marcus Aurelius invite us to embark upon a journey of inner fortitude and tranquility, to embrace life&amp;rsquo;s adversities with grace and poise.</description>

      <title>Learning is a good thing</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Learning is a good thing, even for one who is growing old. From Sextus the philosopher I shall learn what I do not yet know.&amp;rdquo;
Learning is a continuous process. A never-ending journey towards wisdom and knowledge that one travels along for the course of their life. It is a process that does not discriminate based on age or social status. No matter how old one may be, there is always room for growth, for improvement and for enlightenment.</description>

      <title>Retreat into your own mind</title>
      <link>/quotes/marcus-aurelius/retreat-into-your-own-mind/</link>

      <guid>/quotes/marcus-aurelius/retreat-into-your-own-mind/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;No retreat offers someone more quiet and relaxation than that into his own mind, especially if he can dip into thoughts there which put him at immediate and complete ease: and by ease I simply mean a well-ordered life. So constantly give yourself this retreat, and renew yourself. The doctrines you will visit there should be few and fundamental, sufficient at one meeting to wash away all your pain and send you back free of resentment at what you must rejoin.</description>

      <title>Train your thoughts</title>
      <link>/quotes/marcus-aurelius/train-your-thoughts/</link>

      <guid>/quotes/marcus-aurelius/train-your-thoughts/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: Everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly, everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, ‘What are you thinking about?’ you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that.”
My dear reader, allow me to expound upon the meaning behind this quote. It is a fundamental tenet of Stoicism that one must control and regulate their thoughts, for the mind is the birthplace of all action and emotion.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can&amp;rsquo;t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;So with people’s dispositions; some are pliable and easy to manage, but others have to be laboriously wrought out by hand, so to speak, and are wholly employed in the making of their own foundations. I should accordingly deem more fortunate those who have never had any trouble with themselves; but the others, I feel, have deserved better of themselves, who have won a victory over the meanness of their own nature, and have not gently led, but have wrestled their way to wisdom.</description>

      <guid>/quotes/seneca/putting-things-off-is-the-biggest-waste-of-life/</guid>
      <description>“Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortune’s control, and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To what goal are you straining? The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.</description>
