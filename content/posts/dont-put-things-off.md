> "Remember how long you have been putting this off, how many times you have been given a period of grace by the gods and not used it. It is high time now for you to understand the universe of which you are a part, and the governor of that universe of whom you constitute an emanation: and that there is a limit circumscribed to your time - if you do not use it to clear away your clouds, it will be and the opportunity will not return. gone, and you will be gone"

My dear reader, here I'm speaking about the importance of using the time given to us by the gods wisely. We must be mindful of the opportunities that come our way and take advantage of them, for time is a precious commodity. One that cannot be regained once it has passed. The universe has a governor, and our actions and thoughts are an emanation of this universal force.

As I mentioned in the previous quote, it is of utmost importance that we understand the universe and our role within it. This understanding will not only bring us closer to the universal governor, but it will also help us make the most of our time. By gaining a deeper understanding of the world around us, we are able to clear away our doubts, fears, and misconceptions. These obstacles often prevent us from fully embracing the opportunities that come our way, and if left unchecked, they can limit our potential and leave us feeling unfulfilled.

It is only by being mindful of how we spend our time that we can truly make the most of every moment. Be more intentional about the choices you make and the actions that result. We must be diligent in our pursuit of knowledge and understanding, and we must be willing to let go of what no longer serves us. In doing so, we create space for growth and progress, and we open ourselves up to the limitless possibilities of the universe.

As a student of philosophy, I believe in the importance of living in harmony with the universe and its laws. We must strive to align our thoughts and actions with the universal order, and this requires a deep understanding of the world around us. It is only by attaining this understanding that we can truly make the most of the time we have been given.

So I implore you, dear reader, to not delay in seeking a deeper understanding of the world and your place within it. Do not waste time that could be put to good use today in hope of something better tomorrow. Doing the work today, will make tomorrow all the better.

Use the time given to you wisely, for it is a precious commodity that can never be regained. And remember, as the ancient philosopher, Heraclitus, once said, "No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man." So too, each moment is unique and cannot be regained. Seize the opportunity before it passes you by. 

Always remember that time is a precious commodity. How we spend it will determine the quality of our lives. Use it to buy the focus needed to take opportunities when they are present, instead of spending it to watch good fortune go by.
