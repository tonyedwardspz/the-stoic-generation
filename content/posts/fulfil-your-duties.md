>"At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: "I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”
>
>So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?
>
>You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you."

I believe in the importance of understanding one's place in the world and fulfilling one's duties as a human being. So should you.

This passage speaks of the struggle one may face in the morning. The warm comfort of one's bed beckons, asking for your company for just another half an hour. In these moments, one must remind themselves of their purpose. To participate in the tasks and experiences of the world. Just as the plants, birds, ants, spiders, and bees perform their individual tasks to contribute to the order of the world, so too must we fulfil our role as part of the cosmic order.

The reluctance to rise from one's bed may stem from a lack of self-love and an ignorance of one's own nature and its demands. To truly love oneself is to love one's responsibilities and commitments and to embrace the duties it imposes. Therefore, when faced with such struggles, one should reflect upon their purpose and obligations. Not only as a human being but also as a part of the larger cosmic order. 

I cannot stress the importance of self-reflection and self-awareness when seeking to live a fulfilling and meaningful life. In the words of Socrates, "An unexamined life is not worth living.", a sentiment I wholeheartedly agree with. To understand one's place in the world and to fulfil one's obligations, it is necessary to examine your own nature and the duties it imposes. It is only through structured introspection that one can truly come to understand their own nature, their purpose, and the role they play in the larger cosmic order.

It is not enough to simply go through the motions of daily life. One must actively engage with their surroundings and participate in the world, fulfilling their duties with purpose and meaning. It is only through such engagement that one can truly experience the richness of life and the joy of living.

I urge you to take control of your life. To embrace your nature and your duties. To live each day with purpose and meaning. Stoicism offers a road map for a life of virtue, wisdom, and fulfillment. It is my hope that these lessons will help guide you on your own journey. To shirk one's duties is to reject one's own nature and to live a life devoid of purpose and meaning. 

Don't fall into the trap.
