description: "No retreat offers someone more quiet and relaxation than that into his own mind, especially if he can dip into thoughts there which put him at immediate and complete ease: and by ease I simply mean a well-ordered life."

> "No retreat offers someone more quiet and relaxation than that into his own mind, especially if he can dip into thoughts there which put him at immediate and complete ease: and by ease I simply mean a well-ordered life. So constantly give yourself this retreat, and renew yourself. The doctrines you will visit there should be few and fundamental, sufficient at one meeting to wash away all your pain and send you back free of resentment at what you must rejoin."

Ah, this quote is one that speaks to the core of Stoic philosophy. The idea that one can find peace and tranquility within the self, through contemplation and introspection, is a fundamental tenet of Stoicism. Being able to dip into one's own mind, to engage in thoughts that bring about a well-ordered life is a valuable gift.

For me, this retreat into the self was not just a source of solace and serenity. It's also a means of self-improvement and growth. When one can reflect upon their own thoughts, they can gain greater clarity and insight into their own character and motivations. This self-awareness then becomes a tool for shaping one's character, for living a life that is virtuous, just and meaningful.

To achieve this retreat into the self, one must cultivate a sense of mindfulness and presence. This requires regular, intentional practice, of setting aside distractions and external noise, and focusing one's attention on the present moment. Like Epictetus said, "It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters".

Here is a list of practical steps one can take towards attaining this inner peace:

- Take time every day to meditate and reflect upon one's thoughts. Give yourself space to have a clear mind.
- Engage in self-reflection through journaling or conversation with a trusted friend.
- Focus on the present moment. Try not to dwell on the past or worry about the future.
- Be mindful of one's thoughts and actions. Strive to align them with one's immutable values.
- Cultivate an attitude of gratitude. Recognising the good in one's life will help you to appreciate the true wealth that is a part in your life.

A retreat into one's own mind is not only a source of peace and relaxation, but also a means of personal growth and development. Make this retreat a regular habit. Carve out the time in your calendar for retreats. Doing so allows one to live a life that is well-ordered, virtuous and fulfilling.
