> "Since nothing can be more perfect than the universe and nothing is better than excellence, the universe must posses excellence. Human nature is not perfect, but excellence may be found in humans. How much more easily does the universe achieve it!"

My dear learned friend. Here I'm reflecting on the concept of excellence and its relationship with the universe and human nature. The universe is perfect, and its excellence is innate. On the other hand, human nature is flawed, and we must strive for excellence. But how can we achieve this excellence?

We must look to the universe as an example. The heavens achieve it effortlessly. So can you. Aim to create a life where excellence comes as easily as it does to the universe. How? By forming habits and routines that lead to greatness, making deliberate choices that align with our values and creating personal laws that steer our actions towards excellence.

Of utmost importance is the cultivation of virtues. Everything else stems from them. They enable us to live a good life and fulfil our potential as human beings. They are the building blocks of excellence, facilitating a meaningful and fulfilling life.

Our school identifies four cardinal virtues that are essential to living a virtuous life:

- Wisdom
- Courage
- Justice
- Self-control

Wisdom is the ability to discern what is right and wrong and act accordingly. It involves using reason to make informed decisions and learning from our experiences.

Courage is to face challenges and adversity with bravery and determination, even when difficult. It requires us to act in the face of fear and to stand up for what we believe in.

Justice is the virtue of fairness and impartiality. It involves treating others with respect and compassion and upholding the principles of fairness and equality. It requires us to act in accordance with universal moral principles, even when it may be inconvenient or difficult.

Self-control is the ability to regulate our emotions and desires and act according to reason. It involves practising restraint and discipline and avoiding excess of all forms.

Cultivating these virtues requires conscious effort and practice. It is not enough to simply know the virtues; we must actively work to incorporate them into our lives. This involves developing habits and routines that align with our values and making deliberate choices that lead us towards virtue. It also requires us to be mindful of our thoughts and actions and reflect on our progress towards virtue.

Let us look to the universe as an example and strive to create a life where greatness comes as efficiently as possible. Building a life around virtue will allow us to achieve excellence as passively as the universe does. Curate personal laws to guide yourselves, much like the laws of physics continuously guide the moon around the earth and the planets around the sun. By doing so, we can lead a life of excellence and find fulfilment in pursuing progress.

As Epictetus once said, "Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens." Let us focus on what we can control and strive for excellence in all aspects of our lives.
