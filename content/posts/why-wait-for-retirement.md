"You will hear many people saying: ‘When I am fifty I shall retire into leisure; when I am sixty I shall give up public duties.’ And what guarantee do you have of a longer life? Who will allow your course to proceed as you arrange it? Aren’t you ashamed to keep for yourself just the remnants of your life, and to devote to wisdom only that time which cannot be spent on any business? How late it is to begin really to live just when life must end!"

Paulinus, allow me to explore this idea some more so your can better comprehend.

It is a common trap that many fall into. To plan for a future of leisure and wisdom while neglecting the moment you inhabit. So many of us think that we will have plenty of time to enjoy the pleasures of life once we have achieved success or reached a certain age. We tell ourselves, "When I am fifty, I shall retire into leisure; when I am sixty, I shall give up public duties." However, you must ask yourself: 

Who can guarantee us a longer life? 

Who can say that we will be allowed to proceed with our plans uninterrupted?

It is essential to recognise that life is unpredictable. We are still determining the length of our time on this earth until our last breath is drawn. Death can come to us at any moment. There may be no warning nor an opportunity to prepare. As such, we must be careful not to take our lives for granted and use our time to its fullest potential.

We must make the most of our time and strive to live a life of meaning and purpose. To do your work, but fill the rest of your day by pursuing a passion or hobby. Hobbies provide us with a deep sense of fulfilment and joy, allowing us to escape the stresses and pressures of daily life. This healthy escape is one of the keys to leading a happy life.

Whether painting, writing, gardening, or playing music, engaging in a hobby can help us develop new skills, explore our creativity, and gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. They also give us a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, helping us build confidence and self-esteem.

Furthermore, pursuing a hobby can help us to create a more balanced and fulfilling life. Engaging in activities we enjoy can reduce stress, improve our mental health, and increase our overall sense of well-being. It is important to remember that life is not just about work and responsibilities; it is also about finding joy and meaning in the things we love.

In light of this, please take this moment to reflect on your own life. Are you spending your time wisely, or are you putting off essential pursuits until a later date? Recognise that every moment is precious, and we must make the most of our allotted time. It is still possible to begin living a life of purpose and intention. But it would be best if you act now. 

It's not yet too late.
