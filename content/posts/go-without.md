"Set aside now and then a number of days during which you will be content with the plainest of food, and very little of it, and with rough, coarse clothing, and will ask yourself, ‘Is this what one used to dread?"

Allow me to share with you a valuable lesson that I have learned in my years of practicing Stoicism. The passage here carries a profound meaning that I wish to explore further with you.

The modern world is filled with a constant barrage of advertisements, social media, and consumerism that convince us that happiness can be bought with material possessions. We are taught to believe that we need the latest gadgets, the most fashionable clothing, and the fanciest cars to be happy. However, these desires are never truly satisfied, and we find ourselves always wanting more, never content with what we have.

In contrast, living a simple life allows us to appreciate the present moment and find joy in the little things. It teaches us to be grateful for what we have and to focus on the things that truly matter. By stripping away the excess, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.

Moreover, living simply allows us to cultivate our character and virtues such as self-control, humility, and gratitude. It is through these virtues that we can find true fulfilment and meaning in life. For it is not the external factors that determine our happiness, but rather the internal disposition that we bring to each moment.

Thus, I urge you to take a step back from your current way of life and set aside a few days to live with the bare minimum. Eat plain food, wear coarse clothing, and live without the luxuries that you have grown so accustomed to. During this time, reflect on the simplicity of your life and ask yourself, "Is this what I used to dread?" You may be daunted to be faced with just the bare minimum. This is understandable. However, I assure you that it's a worthwhile exercise that helps you to gain a deeper appreciation of simple pleasures. 

Here are two practices you can implement today to live a simpler life:

- *Practice gratitude*:  
Each day, take a few moments to reflect on the things that you are grateful for in your life. This could be as simple as being grateful for the food that you eat, the roof over your head, or the people in your life. By focusing on the things that you have, rather than the things that you lack, you can cultivate a sense of gratitude and contentment.

- *Declutter your space*:  
Take a weekend to declutter your living space and get rid of any possessions that you no longer need. This could be clothes that you haven't worn in years, books that you no longer read, or electronics that are outdated. By simplifying your living space, you can create a sense of calm and clarity in your life.

Always remember that the goal of this exercise is not to rid yourself of the things that you enjoy permanently. Rather, it is to help you realise that you can be content with less and that happiness comes from within. By taking a step back from the excess and practicing simplicity, you can gain a new perspective on your life and find joy in the little things.

Living a simple life is not about deprivation or asceticism. It is about understanding that material possessions and luxuries are not necessary for our happiness. It is about being content with what we have, cultivating our virtues, and finding joy in the present moment. As the wise Epictetus once said, "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it." So let us not waste our time pursuing material possessions and instead focus on the things that truly matter in life.
