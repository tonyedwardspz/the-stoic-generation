> "Wealth is not one of the good things; great expenditure is one of the bad; moderation is one of the good things. And moderation invites to frugality and the acquisition of good things: but wealth invites to great expenditure and draws us away from moderation. It is more difficult for a rich man to be moderate, or for a moderate man to be rich."

My fellow traveller on the path to virtuous living, hear my words and take heed. In this fragment, I speak of the dangers of wealth and the virtues of moderation. Wealth, in and of itself, is not a good thing. Instead, it is a tool that can be used for either good or bad. 

Moderation is the opposite of wealth. A perfect thing that leads you towards a happy and content life. Pursuing material possessions and luxuries can lead us down a path of excess and indulgence. This, in turn, can pull us away from the virtues of moderation and frugality.

That is what Moderation is. A true virtue. One that emphasises balance and invites us to live a life of self-control in all aspects of life. It allows us to enjoy the good things in life without succumbing to the temptations of excess. By embracing moderation, we can acquire the good things in life without losing sight of what truly matters.

When we embrace moderation, we are better able to appreciate the contents of our lives and avoid the excesses that can lead to unhappiness and dissatisfaction. By cultivating a sense of frugality, we can learn to live within our means and avoid the trap of materialism and consumerism. Frugality does not mean we should deprive ourselves of all pleasures in life. Instead, it means we should prioritise our spending and focus on acquiring the things that truly bring us joy and fulfilment. By practising frugality, we can avoid the constant cycle of consumption and waste that characterises modern society and instead find contentment in life's simple pleasures.

The acquisition of things is not just about material possessions. It is also about cultivating kindness, compassion, and wisdom. However, I warn you that wealth can be a dangerous seduction. It can draw us away from the path of moderation and into a world of indulgence and extravagance. The acquisition of wealth can cloud our judgment and lead us astray from the virtues of frugality and self-control.

Thus, I urge you to cultivate the virtue of moderation in your daily life. By doing so, you can resist the lure of excess and avoid the pitfalls of wealth. Remember, it is more difficult for a rich man to be moderate or for a moderate man to be rich. Therefore, strive to live a life of balance and moderation, and you will be well on your way to a life of true happiness and fulfilment.
