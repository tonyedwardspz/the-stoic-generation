Change is an inevitable part of life. It is essential that you accept it. Change is a natural phenomenon, one that is integral to the functioning of the world around us. We cannot resist change because it is an inherent part of our existence. We must learn to embrace it, adapt to it, and use it to our advantage.

Consider the examples I have present here. Can you take a hot bath and leave the firewood in the forest? Can you eat a nutritious meal without transforming the raw ingredients? Perhaps, but you'll miss out on one of life's purest pleasures. Gastronomy. These are everyday experiences that we encounter, and they all involve some form of fluctuation from the default state. Without change, nothing can exist or function as it should. Change is not something to be feared but rather to be accepted and utilised.

The idea of embracing change within ourselves is a central tenet of our philosophy. To truly embrace change, we must develop a sense of self-awareness and recognize our inner thoughts and emotions. We must be open to the possibility that our thoughts and beliefs can change, and be willing to adapt accordingly. It won't be easy. But by doing so we can learn to navigate the endless obstacles that life presents us.

When we resist change, we limit ourselves and become stuck in our ways. We become attached to certain ideas, beliefs, or behaviors, even if they are no longer serving us. This attachment can be harmful, as it prevents us from  adapting to new situations and the personal growth which comes with it. Ultimately, it will lead to stagnation and an inability to move forward in life.

I urge you to embrace change and to develop a sense of detachment from our thoughts and emotions. This does not mean that we should suppress or ignore our feelings. Quite the contrary. We should approach them with a sense of mindfulness and objectivity. By observing our thoughts and emotions, we can begin to understand them more deeply and develop a greater sense of self-awareness.

In essence, change is a natural and vital process. You must accept and work with it. Don't cower in fear at the thought of it. See this natural process as an opportunity for growth and development. As I wrote elsewhere in my Meditations, "The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it." We must learn to embrace change and use it to our advantage, rather than fearing it and being left behind by the world around us.
